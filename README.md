# ProDev Frontend Engineering ‚Äì Learning Hub & Nexus Project Documentation

This repository serves as a **documentation hub** for my major learnings from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program** and as a tracker for the **Nexus Project**.

## üìå Program Overview

The **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program** is an intensive journey designed to build strong, responsive, industry-ready frontend development skills. It covers **web, mobile, and progressive web application (PWA) development** using modern technologies and best practices.

The program combines **theoretical foundations with hands-on projects**, preparing developers to design, build, and deploy scalable applications.

## üîë Key Technologies

- **Next.js** ‚Äì For modern React-based web applications

- **TailwindCSS** ‚Äì For utility-first, responsive styling

- **SCSS/SASS** - For custom, responsive, DRY styling

- **TypeScript** ‚Äì For type safety and better maintainability

- **Expo** ‚Äì For mobile development (React Native)

- **GraphQL** ‚Äì For structured API queries (movie app project)

- **REST APIs** ‚Äì For backend communication (Airbnb clone project)

- **PWA (Progressive Web Apps)** ‚Äì For offline-first and installable web apps

## üß© Core Concepts & Practices

- **System Design & Analysis** ‚Äì Laying out architecture before building projects

- **Frontend Best Practices** ‚Äì Code structure, scalability, and maintainability

- **State Management** ‚Äì Using TypeScript and modern React state techniques

- **API Integration** ‚Äì Working with both REST and GraphQL APIs

- **Deployment** ‚Äì Deploying projects with Vercel for production-ready apps

## üèóÔ∏è Projects & Applications

**1. Airbnb Clone (from Figma ‚Üí Next.js ‚Üí Deployed)**

    - Converted **Figma designs** into a fully functional web app

    - Built with **Next.js + TailwindCSS**

    - Integrated with a **REST API** for property and booking data

    - Deployed successfully on **Vercel**

**2. Movie App (GraphQL Integration)**

    - Practiced GraphQL queries and mutations

    - Implemented frontend using React + Apollo Client

    - Learned structured API consumption and caching strategies

**3. Mobile Development (Expo)**

    - Built and tested mobile apps with React Native + Expo

    - Explored cross-platform components and mobile deployment workflows

**4. Progressive Web App (PWA)**

    - Implemented a PWA version of the Airbnb clone

    - Added features like offline support and ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù installation

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Debugging API integration in the Airbnb clone  
  **Solution:** Implemented error boundaries, used Axios interceptors, and tested endpoints with Postman before integration.

- **Challenge:** Managing state in a large Next.js app  
  **Solution:** Introduced TypeScript with strict types and Context API for predictable state handling.

- **Challenge:** Deploying PWA with service workers on Vercel  
  **Solution:** Configured Next.js PWA plugin and tested offline behavior thoroughly before production deployment.

- **Challenge:** Learning GraphQL after being used to REST  
  **Solution:** Practiced with a Movie App project using Apollo Client to understand queries, mutations, and caching strategies.

## üìö Best practices and personal takeaways.

**Through this journey, I:**

- Improved in scalable frontend architecture

- Gained confidence in Next.js & React ecosystem

- Practiced full-cycle app development (from Figma ‚Üí Deployment)

- Learned to balance REST vs GraphQL in real-world use cases

- Built a solid foundation for both web and mobile development
